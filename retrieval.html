    <h1>Retrieval</h1>
    <h2>How Do We Measure Retention?</h2>
    <h3>Recall</h3>
    <p>When information have to be retrieved from previous memory.</p>

    <h3>Recognition</h3>
    <p>When the information received is familiar with a previous stimulus which means the information have been seen before.</p>

    <h3>Relearning</h3>
    <p>When the information have to be learned again, even when it has previously been learned.</p>

    <h2>Misinformation Effect</h2>
    <p>When a newly learned information changes the previously learned information.</p>

    <h2>Source Amnesia</h2>
    <p>Unable to recall how a piece of information was learned.</p>

    <h2>Retrieval Cues</h2>
    <p>Stimulus that helps with remembering information.</p>
    <h3>Priming</h3>
    <p>The activation of associated memory that helps you to remember information.</p>

    <h3>Mood / State Congruent Memory</h3>
    <p>You have a higher chance of remembering something if you are in the same mood you were when you learned the information.</p>

    <h3>Context Dependent Memory</h3>
    <p>You have a higher chance of remembering something if you are in the same environment you were when you learned the information.</p>
    <img src="assets/context.jpg" width="400" height="200" class="center">
    <h3>Serial Position Effect / Primacy and Recency Effect</h3>
    <p>You are more likely to remember the first and last thing on a list instead of the things in the middle.</p>
