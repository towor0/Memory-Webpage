    <h1>Encoding</h1>
    <h2>Automatic Vs. Effortful Processing</h2>
    <p>Automatic Processing is when information are automatically processed without any effort, with effortful processing being the opposite, needing to use effort to process information.</p>

    <h3>Implicit Vs. Explicit Memories</h3>
    <p>Similar to automatic and effortful processing, implicit memories are the memories you can remember unconsciously with implicit memories being the memories that takes efforts to remember.</p>

    <h2>Effortful Processing Strategies</h2>
    <h3>Chunking</h3>
    <p>Breaking large amount of information into chunks, so it's more manageable.</p>

    <h3>Mnemonics</h3>
    <p>Turning information into another form like auditory information or visual information which helps you remember information better.</p>

    <h3>Hierarchies</h3>
    <p>Categorize information into different similar characteristics to help remember different information.</p>

    <h2>The Spacing Effect</h2>
    <p>It's easier for us to remember information if it's stored over time. Instead of studying the day right before a test, it's better for us to study over a few days before the test.</p>

    <h2>Shallow Vs. Deep Processing</h2>
    <p>Shallow processing is when we remember a piece of meaningless information which we will forget quickly; however, deep processing is when we try to store information with meaningful association with it.</p>
